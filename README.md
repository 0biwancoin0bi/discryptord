discryptord
===========
A Discord bot that will amaze your friends by emitting a *6H* chart for any magic internet currency.

## Usage
```
?price <TICKER>
```

## Prerequisites
You need to have a [bra](https://github.com/Unknwon/bra) fitted to your terminal.
You can hire a bra (..maker?) by reciting:

```zsh
% go get github.com/Unknwon/bra
```

## Install
Although the ancient method of invoking this minor god has long been forgotten, our leading scientists believe the magic cantation with the most promise goes something like:

```zsh
% go get github.com/flaymingyawn/discryptord
```

No promises, doe.

## Getting Started
First, create a bot friend on discord.
Then invite it to the channel(s) you want it to stalk...
Next, copy its **BOT_TOKEN** to your magic clipboard.

Go into this package's home directory and whisper this into your terminal:

```zsh 
  % echo "BOT_TOKEN" >> .token
```

Finally, speak

```zsh
  % bra run
```

to start the _real_ fun.
