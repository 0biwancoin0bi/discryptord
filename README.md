discryptord
===========
A Discord bot that will amaze your friends by emitting a *6H* chart for any magic internet currency.

## Usage
```
?price <TICKER>
```

## Prerequisites
You need to have a [bra](https://github.com/Unknwon/bra) fitted to your terminal.
You can hire a bra (..maker?) by reciting:

```zsh
% go get github.com/Unknwon/bra
```

## Install
Althought the true method of invoking this minor `GO`d, our leading scientists think the magic cantation with the most promise goes like:

```zsh
% go get github.com/flaymingyawn/discryptord
```

No promises, doe.

## Getting Started
First, create a bot friend on discord.
Then invite it to the channel(s) you want it to stalk...
Next, copy its UserId to your magic clipboard.

Go into this package's home directory and whisper this into your terminal:

```zsh 
  % echo "<User_Id>" >> .token
```

Finally, speak

```zsh
  % bra run
```

to start the _real_ fun.
